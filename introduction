/*
hello this is my first github project i had ever build since i heard that the github community is absolutely kind and heartwarming i thought i would write my instant legacy code here you can
copy if you want so this is an abandoned project i have been working on since the very beginning i was introduced to c++ and as a matter of fact i learned like very fast looked up
documentation and other things so then i started to like the works of john carmack and the other people like lowlevellearning , jdh ,etc. as they were certainly writing instant legacy ultra 
juicy code an i wrote code like a absolute DUMB ASS! blah! blah! blah! im not so good at saying things...
